Counting Sheep:
    The Big O notation for this is O(n), it will iterate through N times until it reaches the end.

Factorial:
    It will iterate N times so the Big O notation is O(n).

Fibonacci:
    This will iterate N times so the Big O notation is O(n).

Power calculator:
    This will be the same no matter what so the run time is O(1).

Reverse String:
    This will iterate N times so the Big O notation is O(n).
    
Triangular Number:
    This will iterate N times so the Big O notation is O(n).

String Splitter: 
    This will iterate N times so the big O notation is O(1).
